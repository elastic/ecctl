## Breaking changes
<!-- Add the list of breaking changes, remove otherwise.-->

### Remove pluralized list commands

Removed all the plurals in ecctl and instead only kept the `ecctl <COMMAND> list` format. Commands removed
by this change are:

* allocators
* constructors
* enrollment-tokens
* proxies
* stacks
* filtered-groups

### Removed deployment elasticsearch create command

There's an upcoming change in ECE 2.5.0 which will remove the ability to create deployments specifying a
custom topology and only allow the creation of deployments which have a `deployment_template_id` present
in the create request. Tying that with the fact that deployment templates might specify required resources
like Kibana or APM to be included on creation, it means 
 thus the `ecctl deployment elasticsearch create` command has been removed

## Notable changes
<!-- Add the list of notable changes, remove otherwise.-->

### Migrated creation of Kibana and APM resources to the Deployments API

Migrated all of the creation endpoints to the deployments API.

### Version output has been extended

`ecctl version` returns much more information:

```command
$ ecctl version
Version:               1.0.0-beta1
Client API Version:    2.4.2
Go version:            go1.13.5
Git commit:            4fcde59a
Built:                 Fri 20 Dec 05:58:12 2019
OS/Arch:               darwin / amd64
```

### --track flag is available for most commands which incur deployment plan changes

Added resource change tracking capabilities to:

* `deployment create`
* `deployment update`
* `deployment shutdown`

### --override-failsafe is now available on vacate operations

Added an `--override-failsafe` flag to `ecctl platform allocator vacate`, which cause the Elastic Cloud
to accept changes even when believed to lead to data loss. **Use with caution**.

## New Commands
<!--  Add the list of new commands, remove otherwise.-->

### Added all deployment commands

Added all the missing commands which implement their API counterpart:

* `ecctl deployment create`        Creates a deployment from a file definition, allowing certain flag overrides
* `ecctl deployment delete`        Deletes a previously stopped deployment from the platform
* `ecctl deployment list`          Lists the platform's deployments
* `ecctl deployment restore`       Restores a previously shut down deployment and all of its associated sub-resources
* `ecctl deployment search`        Performs advanced deployment search using the Elasticsearch Query DSL
* `ecctl deployment shutdown`      Shuts down a deployment and all of its associated sub-resources
* `ecctl deployment upgrade`       Updates a deployment from a file definition, allowing certain flag overrides

### Added a plan cancel for the deployment resources

* `ecctl deployment plan cancel`

### Added all deployment resource commands

Added all the deployment resource actions which are available in the API:

* `ecctl deployment resource delete`            Deletes a previously shut down deployment resource
* `ecctl deployment resource restore`           Restores a previously shut down deployment resource
* `ecctl deployment resource shutdown`          Shuts down a deployment resource by its type and ref-id
* `ecctl deployment resource start`             Starts a previously stopped deployment resource
* `ecctl deployment resource start-maintenance` Starts maintenance mode on a deployment resource
* `ecctl deployment resource stop`              Stops a deployment resource
* `ecctl deployment resource stop-maintenance`  Stops maintenance mode on a deployment resource
* `ecctl deployment resource upgrade`           Upgrades a deployment resource

### Added elasticsearch keystore commands

Manages an Elasticsearch cluster's keystore

* `set`         Updates an Elasticsearch cluster keystore with the contents of a file
* `show`        Shows an Elasticsearch cluster's keystore settings

## Bug fixes
<!-- Add the list of bug fixes, remove otherwise.-->

### init command now skips tls validation

It was reported that in some instances `ecctl init` would return with an error even after providing valid
credentials, this was mainly due to ecctl performing TLS validation where a lot of ECE installations have
self signed certificates. It now will skip TLS Verification by default.

### init command now writes the JSON config without returning an error

The default directory for configuration (`~/.ecctl`) was oftentimes not created in the machine where the
command was being run, which caused the configuration to not be written to that folder. This has been fixed.

### --timeout flag is now honored

Using the `--timeout` global flag now has the desired effect in any of the commands, where before a static 30s
timeout was used from the default transport even when `http.Client.Timeout` being overriden.

### Unexpected errors are now unpacked instead of returning "unknown error (status xxx)"

Leverages the new unwrapping capabilites of `api.UnwapError` which now unwraps the API errors which previously
were returned as `unknown error (status xxx)`.

### Fix broken "user key show" command

The command was broken since the UserID wasn't specified and the Key ID was being set instead of the User ID.
The command now works as expected.

## Docs
<!-- Add the list of doc changes, remove otherwise.-->

### Added ASCIIDoc for commands

### Added auto-completion instructions to the docs
