	apmCreateLong = `Creates an APM deployment, limitting the creation scope to APM resources.
There are a few ways to create an APM deployment, sane default values are provided, making
the command work out of the box even when no parameters are set. When version is not specified,
the matching elasticsearch deployment version will be used. These are the available options:

  * Simplified flags: --zones <zone count> --size <node memory in MB>
  * File definition: --file=<file path> (shorthand: -f). The definition can be found in:
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/definitions.html#ApmPayload

As an option, "--generate-payload" can be used in order to obtain the generated ApmPayload
that would be sent as a request, save it, update or extend the topology and create an Apm
deployment using the saved payload with the "--file" flag.`
