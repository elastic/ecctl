==== What's new

* *New top level command: `ecctl comment`.* Includes commands to create, delete, list, show and update comments for any of the Elastic Cloud resources: `elasticsearch`, `kibana`, `apm`, `appsearch`, `enterprise_search`, `allocator`, `constructor`, `runner`, `proxy`.

* *New deployment command: `ecctl deployment traffic-filter`.* Includes commands to create, delete, list and show traffic filter rules and the `ecctl deployment traffic-filter association` sub-command includes two more sub-commands to create and delete associations between traffic rules and deployments.

* *New deployment command: `ecctl deployment extension`.* Includes commands to create, delete list and show custom deployment extensions such as Elasticsearch bundles or plugins.

* *Added support for data tiers in all `ecctl deployment` commands.*

[id="{p}-release-notes-v1.3.0-bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

* *Improved deployment tracking.* The deployment tracking has been improved. It now fails only when the plan completes with a failure, instead of returning errors from other steps of the plan.

[float]
[id="{p}-release-notes-v1.3.0-breaking-changes"]
==== Breaking changes

* *Deployment create drops support flag-based actions.* Instance definition flags for the `ecctl deployment create` command have been removed. Using a predefined deployment definition JSON file is still optional with the `--file` flag, and the `--deployment-template` flag can be used to create a deployment from a template using the template configuration. See `ecctl deployment create --help` for a full list of examples.
