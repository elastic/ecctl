== Overview

beta[]

{p} is the CLI for the Elastic Cloud Enterprise API. 
It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

Benefits of {p}:

* Easier to use than the Cloud UI or using the RESTful API directly
* Helps you automate the deployment lifecycle
* Provides a foundation for integration with other tools, such as Terraform and Ansible

[id="{p}-installing"]
== Installing

The latest stable binaries can be found on the
https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/releases[release page] or compiled from
the latest on the master branch to leverage the most recently merged
features. 

To learn more about building {p} from the source, see
the steps from our link:https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-dev-environment[Setting up a dev environment].

=== Install on macOS

The simplest installation for macOS users is to install {p} with
link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]:

[source]
----
$ brew tap elastic/tap
$ brew install elastic/tap/ecctl

== Install on Linux

// NR TO DO with info from https://github.com/elastic/cloud-cli#linux-based-os
 
The simplest installation for Linux-based users is to install ecl with apt-get. We are hosting ecl binaries in a temporary apt repository so you need to do the following:

[source,console]
----
$ echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cloud-soteria-apt-repo stable main" >> etc/apt/sources.list.d/myrepo.list
$ apt-get install ece-ctl -y
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  ece-ctl

After this operation, 13.8 MB of additional disk space will be used.

[id="{p}-configuring"]
== Configuring

In order for {p} to be able to communicate with the RESTful API, it needs
to have a set of configuration parameters defined.
These parameters can be set in a configuration file, through environment
variables, or at runtime using the CLI‚Äôs global flags.

[float]
=== Before you begin
The hierarchy for configuration parameters is as follows, from higher precedence to lower:

. Command line flags `--host`, `--user`, `--pass`
. Environment variables
. Shared configuration file
`$HOME/.ecctl/config.<json|toml|yaml|hcl>`

[float]
== Generate a configuration file

If it‚Äôs your first time using {p}, use the `init` command to assist you in generating a configuration file. The resulting configuration file will be saved under `~/.ecctl/config.json`:

[source]
----
$ ecctl init
Welcome to the Elastic Cloud CLI! This command will guide you through authenticating and setting some default values.

Missing configuration file, would you like to initialise it? [y/n]: y

Select which type of Elastic Cloud offering will you be working with:
  [1] Elasticsearch Service (default).
  [2] Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE).
  [3] Elasticsearch Service Private (ESSP).

Please enter your choice: 1

Using "https://api.elastic-cloud.com" as the API endpoint.

Paste your API Key and press enter: xxxxx

What default output format would you like?
  [1] text - Human-readable output format, commands with no output templates defined will fall back to JSON.
  [2] json - JSON formatted output API responses.

Please enter a choice: 1

Your credentials seem to be valid, and show you're authenticated as "user".

You're all set! Here is a command to try:
  $ ecctl deployment list
----

[id="{p}-authentication"]
=== Authentication

Elastic Cloud uses API keys to authenticate users against its API.
Additionally, it supports the usage of https://jwt.io/[JWT] to validate
authenticated clients. The preferred authentication method is API keys.

There are two ways to authenticate against the Elasticsearch Service or the Elastic Cloud Enterprise APIs
{p}:

* By specifying an API key using the `--apikey` flag
* By specifying the `--user` and `--pass` flags

The first method requires the user to already have an API key, if this
is the case, all the outgoing API requests will use an Authentication
API key header.

The second method uses the `user` and `pass` values to obtain a
valid JWT token, that token is then used as the Authentication
Bearer¬†header for every API call. A goroutine that refreshes the token
every minute is started, so that the token doesn‚Äôt expire while we‚Äôre
performing actions.

[id="{p}-example-shared-configuration-file"]
=== Example: A shared configuration file

Below is an example `YAML` configuration file
`$HOME/.ecctl/config.yaml` that will effectively point and configure
the binary for Elastic Cloud:

[source,yaml]
----
host: https://api.elastic-cloud.com # URL of your Elasticsearch Service or Elastic Cloud Enterprise API endpoint

# Credentials
## apikey is the preferred authentication mechanism.
apikey: bWFyYzo4ZTJmNmZkNjY5ZmQ0MDBkOTQ3ZjI3MTg3ZWI5MWZhYjpOQktHY05jclE0cTBzcUlnTXg3QTd3

##¬†username and password can be used when no API key is available.
user: username
pass: password
----

[id="{p}-environment-variables"]
=== Environment variables

The same settings can be defined as environment variables instead of a
configuration file or to override certain settings of the `YAML` file.
If setting environment variables, you‚Äôll need to prefix the
configuration parameter with `EC_` and capitalize the setting,
i.e.¬†`EC_HOST` or `EC_USER`.

[source,sh]
----
export EC_APIKEY=bWFyYzo4ZTJmNmZkNjY5ZmQ0MDBkOTQ3ZjI3MTg3ZWI5MWZhYjpOQktHY05jclE0cTBzcUlnTXg3QTd3
----

[float]
[id="{p}-special-environment-variables"]
==== Special Environment Variables

[source,sh]
----
export EC_CONFIG=$HOME/.ecctl/cloud.yaml
----

[id="{p}-multiple-configuration-files"]
=== Multiple configuration files

{p} supports having multiple configuration files out of the box.
This allows for easy management of multiple environments or specialized
targets. By default it will use
`$HOME/.ecctl/config.<json|toml|yaml|hcl>`, but when the `--config`
flag is specified, it will append the `--config` name to the file:

[source]
----
# Default behaviour
$ ecctl version
# will use ~/.ecctl/config.yaml

# When an environment is specified, the configuration file used will change
$ ecctl version --config ece
# will use ~/.ecctl/ece.yaml
----

[id="{p}-output-format"]
=== Output format

The `--output` flag allows for the response to be presented in a
particular way (see `ecctl help` for an updated list of allowed
formats). The default formatter behavior is to fallback to `json` when
there‚Äôs no _text_ format template or if the formatting fails.

[id="{p}-custom-formatting"]
=== Custom formatting

{p} supports a global `--format` flag which can be passed to any
existing command or subcommand. Using the `--format` flag allows you
to obtain a specific part of a command response that might not have been
shown before with the default `--output=text`. The `--format`
internally uses Go templates which means that you can use the power of
the Go built-in
https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[`text/templates`] on demand.

[id="{p}-examples"]
== Usage examples

To create your first deployment, use the `ecctl deployment create` command, which accepts https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/blob/master/docs/ecctl_deployment_create.md#examples[a deployment description in the form of a JSON file] and a stack version and name as inputs.

[source,sh]
--
ecctl deployment create --file ./deployment.json --name=my-new-deployment --version=7.4.1
{
  "created": true,
  "id": "c44ad3fa558a237d0c17d0f4273801df",
  "name": "my example cluster",
  "resources": [
    {
      "cloud_id": "my_elasticsearch_cluster:REDACTED",
      "credentials": {
        "password": "REDACTED",
        "username": "elastic"
      },
      "id": "edd8b0bf7ece46dab47acc7074a7f191",
      "kind": "elasticsearch",
      "ref_id": "my-es-cluster",
      "region": "ece-region"
    },
    {
      "elasticsearch_cluster_ref_id": "my-es-cluster",
      "id": "44dd3575894b4fc89bd600f56d1c130d",
      "kind": "kibana",
      "ref_id": "my-kibana-instance",
      "region": "ece-region"
    },
    {
      "elasticsearch_cluster_ref_id": "my-es-cluster",
      "id": "9868cd370bdc469a8364ece4fe0db16d",
      "kind": "apm",
      "ref_id": "my-apm-instance",
      "region": "ece-region",
      "secret_token": "REDACTED"
    }
  ]
}

There‚Äôs much more you can use ecctl for. You can  explore ecctl and its various commands by issuing `ecctl <command> <help>` to see the different options that we support. 

// NR as per Omer, ecctl elasticsearch is no longer supported (do we need to mention this in the release notes for beta1?)

Obtaining the ID, Version and health status

Since the template is executed we can also embed logic inside of the
template to filter the results.

[source]
----
$ export EC_FORMAT='{{range .Elasticsearch.DefaultPlugins}}{{if eq . "discovery-file" }}{{$.Version}}{{end}}{{end}}'
# Since the template is executed on every item of the list, filter the empty lines to have a cleaner output.
$ ecctl stack list --format "${EC_FORMAT}" | sed '/^\s*$/d'
