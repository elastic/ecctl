== Overview

beta[]

{p} is the CLI for the Elastic Cloud Enterprise API. 
It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

Benefits of {p}:

* Easier to use than the Cloud UI or using the RESTful API directly
* Helps you automate the deployment lifecycle
* Provides a foundation for integration with other tools

[id="{p}-installing"]
== Installing

The latest stable binaries can be found on the
https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/releases[release page] or compiled from
the latest on the master branch to leverage the most recently merged
features. 

To learn more about building {p} from the source, see
the steps from our link:https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-dev-environment[Setting up a dev environment].

[id="{p}-configuring"]
== Configuring

In order for {p} to be able to communicate with the RESTful API, it needs
to have a set of configuration parameters defined.
These parameters can be set in a configuration file, through environment
variables, or at runtime using the CLI‚Äôs global flags.

[float]
=== Before you begin
The hierarchy for configuration parameters is as follows, from higher precedence to lower:

. Command line flags `--host`, `--user`, `--pass`
. Environment variables
. Shared configuration file
`$HOME/.ecctl/config.<json|toml|yaml|hcl>`

[float]
== Generate a configuration file

If it‚Äôs your first time using {p}, use the `init` command to assist you in generating a configuration file. The resulting configuration file will be saved under `~/.ecctl/config.json`:

[source]
----
$ ecctl init
Welcome to the Elastic Cloud CLI! This command will guide you through authenticating and setting some default values.

Missing configuration file, would you like to initialise it? [y/n]: y

Select which type of Elastic Cloud offering will you be working with:
  [1] Elasticsearch Service (default).
  [2] Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE).
  [3] Elasticsearch Service Private (ESSP).

Please enter your choice: 1

Using "https://api.elastic-cloud.com" as the API endpoint.

Paste your API Key and press enter: xxxxx

What default output format would you like?
  [1] text - Human-readable output format, commands with no output templates defined will fall back to JSON.
  [2] json - JSON formatted output API responses.

Please enter a choice: 1

Your credentials seem to be valid, and show you're authenticated as "user".

You're all set! Here is a command to try:
  $ ecctl deployment list
----

[id="{p}-authentication"]
=== Authentication

Elastic Cloud uses API keys to authenticate users against its API.
Additionally, it supports the usage of https://jwt.io/[JWT] to validate
authenticated clients. The preferred authentication method is API keys.

There are two ways to authenticate against the Elasticsearch Service or the Elastic Cloud Enterprise APIs
{p}:

* By specifying an API key using the `--api-key` flag
* By specifying the `--user` and `--pass` flags

The first method requires the user to already have an API key, if this
is the case, all the outgoing API requests will use an Authentication
API key header.

The second method uses the `user` and `pass` values to obtain a
valid JWT token, that token is then used as the Authentication
Bearer¬†header for every API call. A goroutine that refreshes the token
every minute is started, so that the token doesn‚Äôt expire while we‚Äôre
performing actions.

[id="{p}-example-shared-configuration-file"]
=== Example: A shared configuration file

Below is an example `YAML` configuration file
`$HOME/.ecctl/config.yaml` that will effectively point and configure
the binary for Elastic Cloud:

[source,yaml]
----
host: https://api.elastic-cloud.com # URL of your Elasticsearch Service or Elastic Cloud Enterprise API endpoint

# Credentials
## api_key is the preferred authentication mechanism.
api_key: bWFyYzo4ZTJmNmZkNjY5ZmQ0MDBkOTQ3ZjI3MTg3ZWI5MWZhYjpOQktHY05jclE0cTBzcUlnTXg3QTd3

##¬†username and password can be used when no API key is available.
user: username
pass: password
----

[id="{p}-environment-variables"]
=== Environment variables

The same settings can be defined as environment variables instead of a
configuration file or to override certain settings of the `YAML` file.
If setting environment variables, you‚Äôll need to prefix the
configuration parameter with `EC_` and capitalize the setting,
i.e.¬†`EC_HOST` or `EC_USER`.

[source,sh]
----
export EC_API_KEY=bWFyYzo4ZTJmNmZkNjY5ZmQ0MDBkOTQ3ZjI3MTg3ZWI5MWZhYjpOQktHY05jclE0cTBzcUlnTXg3QTd3
----

[float]
[id="{p}-special-environment-variables"]
==== Special Environment Variables

[source,sh]
----
export EC_CONFIG=$HOME/.ecctl/cloud.yaml
----

[id="{p}-multiple-configuration-files"]
=== Multiple configuration files

{p} supports having multiple configuration files out of the box.
This allows for easy management of multiple environments or specialized
targets. By default it will use
`$HOME/.ecctl/config.<json|toml|yaml|hcl>`, but when the `--config`
flag is specified, it will append the `--config` name to the file:

[source]
----
# Default behaviour
$ ecctl version
# will use ~/.ecctl/config.yaml

# When an environment is specified, the configuration file used will change
$ ecctl version --config ece
# will use ~/.ecctl/ece.yaml
----

[id="{p}-output-format"]
=== Output format

The `--output` flag allows for the response to be presented in a
particular way (see `ecctl help` for an updated list of allowed
formats). The default formatter behavior is to fallback to `json` when
there‚Äôs no _text_ format template or if the formatting fails.

[id="{p}-custom-formatting"]
=== Custom formatting

{p} supports a global `--format` flag which can be passed to any
existing command or subcommand. Using the `--format` flag allows you
to obtain a specific part of a command response that might not have been
shown before with the default `--output=text`. The `--format`
internally uses Go templates which means that you can use the power of
the Go built-in
https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[`text/templates`] on demand.

[id="{p}-examples"]
== Usage examples

Once you've <<{p}-installing,installed>> and <<{p}-configuring,configured>> {p} you're ready to take it for a test drive. Try these examples with basic Create, Read, Update and Delete operations using {p}:

* <<{p}-example-list-deployments,List deploymments>>
* <<{p}-example-create-deployment,Create a deployment>>
* <<{p}-example-update-deployment,Update a deployment>>
* <<{p}-example-delete-deployment,Delete a deployment>>


To compare the {p} commands against their API equivalents, see the {cloud}/ec-api-examples.html[API examples].



[id="{p}-example-list-deployments"]
=== List deployments

As a first example of using {p}, run the <<ecctl_deployment_list,{p} deployment list>> command to retrieve information about existing deployments. This is a good way to check if {p} is configured correctly and if you have any deployments already created.

[id="{p}-example-create-deployment"]
=== Create a deployment

Let's create a basic deployment. Elasticsearch Service supports {cloud}/ec-getting-started-templates.html[deployment templates], which pre-configure the Elastic Stack components in your deployment to best suit your particular use case. For this example, use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host the deployment in region `US Central 1 (Iowa)`. To know which deployment options are available by platform, see {cloud}/ec-regions-templates-instances.html[available regions, deployment templates and instance configurations].

Copy the following JSON payload and save it as file `create-deployment.json`.

The response indicates that the request was submitted successfully. It includes the `elastic` user password, which you can use to log in to Kibana or to access the Elasticsearch REST API. Make a note of the deployment ID, which you will use in the next example.

[id="{p}-example-update-deployment"]
=== Update a deployment

Now that you have used {p} to create a deployment, you can scale it up, by increasing the size of the Elasticsearch data nodes from 1024 to 4096 MB.

Copy the following JSON payload and save it as file `update-deployment.json`.

[source, json]
--
{
  "prune_orphans": false,
  "resources": {
    "elasticsearch": [
      {
        "region": "gcp-us-central1",
        "ref_id": "main-elasticsearch",
        "plan": {
          "cluster_topology": [
            {
              "node_type": {
                "master": true,
                "data": true,
                "ingest": true,
                "ml": false
              },
              "instance_configuration_id": "gcp.data.highio.1",
              "zone_count": 2,
              "size": {
                "resource": "memory",
                "value": 4096
              }
            }
          ],
          "elasticsearch": {
            "version": "7.6.0"
          },
          "deployment_template": {
            "id": "gcp-io-optimized"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
--

The JSON body is similar to what we used to create the deployment, with the following differences:

- The name of the deployment can be modified or it will stay the same if not specified.
- A `prune_orphans` parameter is added. This important parameter specifies how resources not included in the JSON should be handled:
   * if `true`, those resources not included are removed
   * if `false`, those resources not included are kept intact

In this example, prune_orphans is set to `false`, so the Kibana and APM instances are not changed or removed, while the Elasticsearch resource is modified according to the configuration specified in the JSON file.

To monitor the progress, use the `--track` flag.

[source, sh]
--
ecctl deployment update [--track] $DEPLOYMENT_ID -f update-deployment.json
--
* `$DEPLOYMENT_ID` is the ID for the deployment that was created in the previous <<{p}-example-create-deployment,create a deployment>> example.

[id="{p}-example-delete-deployment"]
=== Delete a deployment

In this last example, you can use the <<ecctl_deployment_shutdown,{p} deployment shutdown>> command to delete the deployment that you created.

[source, sh]
--
ecctl deployment shutdown [--track] $DEPLOYMENT_ID
--
* `$DEPLOYMENT_ID` is the ID for the deployment that was created in the previous <<{p}-example-create-deployment,create a deployment>> example.

On running this and other destructive commands, {p} prompts you with a confirmation message. Use the `--force` option to skip the confirmation step, if you are using {p} for automation.

To monitor the progress, use the `--track` flag.

To see the different options that {p} supports, run `ecctl <command> <help>`.
