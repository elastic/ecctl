# Usage examples [ecctl-examples]

Once you’ve [installed](/reference/ecctl-installing.md) and [configured](/reference/ecctl-configuring.md) ecctl you’re ready to take it for a test drive. Try these examples with basic Create, Read, Update and Delete operations using ecctl:

* [List deploymments](/reference/ecctl-example-list-deployments.md)
* [Create a deployment](/reference/ecctl-example-create-deployment.md)
* [Update a deployment](/reference/ecctl-example-update-deployment.md)
* [Delete a deployment](/reference/ecctl-example-delete-deployment.md)

To compare the ecctl commands against their API equivalents, see the [API examples](cloud://docs/reference/cloud-hosted/ec-api-examples.md).
