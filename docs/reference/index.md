# Elastic cloud control (ECCTL) [ecctl-overview]

ecctl is the command-line interface for the [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud) and [Elastic Cloud Enterprise](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud-enterprise/) (ECE) APIs. It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

Benefits of ecctl:

* Easier to use than the Cloud UI or using the RESTful API directly
* Helps you automate the deployment lifecycle
* Provides a foundation for integration with other tools

Stay up to date with the latest changes by reviewing the [ECCTL release notes](/release-notes/index.md).
