# Elastic cloud control (ECCTL) [ecctl-overview]

ecctl is the command-line interface for the Elasticsearch Service and Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) APIs. It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

Benefits of ecctl:

* Easier to use than the Cloud UI or using the RESTful API directly
* Helps you automate the deployment lifecycle
* Provides a foundation for integration with other tools
