=== Elastic Cloud Control (ecctl) v1.0.0-beta1
++++
<titleabbrev>v1.0.0-beta1</titleabbrev>
++++

Elastic cloud control (ecctl) is Elastic’s CLI interface to manage the Elastic Cloud Enterprise platform and is now open for a public beta.

New for v1.0.0-beta1:

* *New APIs for ecctl deployment commands*. With the availability of our deployment APIs for ECE, we’ve switched the `ecctl deployment` commands to make use of the new APIs. This switch ensures better supportability and compatibility with ECE functionality and allows you to fully control your deployments. 
+
Use the `ecctl deployment` commands to:
+
** Create, update, read, and delete deployments
** Perform maintenance and upgrades
** Start and stop deployments 

* *New `elasticsearch keystore` commands*. You can now manage your Elasticsearch keystore through ecctl by setting an Elasticsearch keystore or showing the current configuration.
+
--
Example usage:

`ecctl elasticsearch keystore show` - shows the current keystore configuration

`ecctl elasticsearch keystore set` - sets a new keystore configuration
--

* *Track resource changes using the `--track` flag*. When creating, updating, or shutting down deployments, you can now use the `--track` flag to track progress for changes to deployments in a synchronous manner.

* *Simple initialization*. TLS verification has been turned off for the `init` command so that you can configure ecctl against a self-signed ECE instance with greater ease.

==== Bug fixes

We fixed the following bugs:

* The `ecctl user key show` command no longer sends faulty parameters to the API server and now works as expected. https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/pull/58[#58]
* Issues with the `init` command not being able to persist ecctl configuration to the home directory have been resolved. https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/pull/39[#39]
* The `ecctl` commands now honor the `--timeout` flag in any of the commands as expected, where before a static 30s timeout was used even when `Http.Client.Timeout` was specified. https://github.com/elastic/ecctl/pull/100[#100]
