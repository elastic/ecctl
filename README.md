# Elastic Cloud Control 

![ecctl logo](ecctl.png)

`ecctl` is the CLI for the [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud/) and [Elastic Cloud Enterprise](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud-enterprise/) APIs. It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

The goal of this project is to provide an easier way to interact with the Elastic Cloud and Elastic Cloud Enterprise APIs, ensuring each one of the provided commands is thoroughly tested.

To get started with Elastic Cloud Control, see the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecctl/current/index.html).

_NOTE: While it's possible to create and manage deployments through ecctl, the [Elastic Cloud Terraform provider](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-ec) provides a better interface._
