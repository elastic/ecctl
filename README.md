# Elastic Cloud Control

NOTE: **You are looking at the documentation for a beta release. Please keep in mind that backwards-incompatible changes might be introduced in future releases.**

`ecctl` is the CLI on steroids for the Elastic Cloud Enterprise API. It wraps typical operations commonly needed by ECE operators within a single command line tool.

The goal of this project is to provide an easier way to interact with the ECE API, ensuring each one of the provided commands is thoroughly tested.

Note that, right now, `ecctl` targets ECE installations only. There are, however, plans to support public Elasticsearch Service API in the future.

To get started with Elastic Cloud Control, see the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecctl/current/index.html).
