# Elastic Cloud Control

`ecctl` is the CLI on steroids for the Elastic Cloud API. It wraps common operations commonly needed by Elastic Cloud operators within a single command line tool.

The goal of this project is to provide an easier way to interact with the Elastic Cloud API, ensuring each one of the provided commands is thoroughly tested.

To get started with Elastic Cloud Control, see the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecctl/current/index.html).
