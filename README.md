![](ecctl.png)

NOTE: **You are looking at the documentation for a beta release. Please keep in mind that backwards-incompatible changes might be introduced in future releases.**

`ecctl` is the CLI on steroids for the Elastic Cloud API. It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

The goal of this project is to provide an easier way to interact with the Elastic Cloud API, ensuring each one of the provided commands is thoroughly tested.

To get started with Elastic Cloud Control, see the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecctl/current/index.html).
